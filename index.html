<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>My Response</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Dear UT CS community, this letter is to acknowledge receipt of the letter I was sent regarding my ban. Thank you for raising this important issue to everyone's attention. Here is my response to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>I don't mean any ill will in this document, I am simply seeking to respond to claims that have been made about me and provide the most factual information possible in response to it. I am not a lawyer so I would just like to give that disclaimer, but I can say that I'm trying to be as truthful as possible and state only the facts, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Furry Pictures</strong></p>
<p>There have been pictures that were sent that involved anthropomorphic animals. This incident regards one specific animals. Here is my take on it:</p>
<p>1.That image wasn't furry porn. It literally didn't show anything inappropriate; instead, it just showed anthropomorphic animals (two wolves) who were swimming. There were no genital or inappropriate parts shown in the image, and it clearly passed the nsfw filter since it sent in a sfw channel.<br />2. It wasn't sent in any public chats. Although I cannot recall, it was most likely sent in the <em>#lords-water-cooler</em> chat&nbsp;<br />3. The picture <em>was in fact <strong>sent on accident</strong>, not on purpose.</em> Although I can't prove this, my explanation is this: I have a shared google drive with my friend and he uploads his stuff on there. I mean to upload another picture from the drive, and I accidentally sent that one. I have gone through the drive and although not everything on there is something I would send to my grandparents, it didn't reveal anything specific. The reason I can't send the picture right now is because I have no access to the drive since the server is non-existent anymore so I do not have access to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cosmic Asking</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is probably the most serious accusation, and first of all, yes, I'd like to apologize to Cosmic for this. It was not in good taste to send this. The incident that was being referred to is shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the time, we were voice chatting- the audit logs can attest to this. During this voice chat, we all said some joking things about video chatting, and this was part of the joke. At the time we were talking about doing things on camera (jokingly, of course). I sent that message as a continuation of the joke. Although I cannot attest for the other parties at the time, I can say that to me it was clearly meant as a joke with no serious implications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cosmic took this as a joke, and never spoke up that she was uncomfortable about it because it was a jest. If you look at the chat record, there was no record about Cosmic telling me to stop or to tone it down, because we were all joking.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">However, I would like to be clear on the matter:&nbsp;<strong>It is never okay to joke about that,&nbsp;</strong>because it could be misconstrued. For that, I'd like to apologize to everyone, and to Cosmic: <em>I should have known better than to&nbsp;</em><em>send that.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nevertheless- although I am not a lawyer- I think this was a not serious, isolated incident, that doesn't fall under the definition of sexual harassment because it was a 1 time, non-repeated issue that was clearly meant as a joke- and even if it wasn't taken as a joke, it was not repetitive and I never learned that she felt uncomfortable about the issue.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<strong>Ban Evasion</strong></p>
<p>The current discord community guidelines state the following:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Do not evade user blocks or server bans.&nbsp;Do not send unwanted, repeated friend requests or messages, especially after they&rsquo;ve made it clear they don&rsquo;t want to talk to you anymore. Do not try to hide your identity in an attempt to contact someone who has blocked you, or otherwise circumvent the tools we have which enable users to protect themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;I was told <a href="https://discord.com/channels/748277995239637024/769517327402008588/773289705797451787">I was allowed to join back on the discord</a> through an alt and it wouldn't be evading a ban. From that point on (The time I was told that), all of the conduct through alternative accounts has been legitimate and clean- I haven't done anything naughty since then.<strong> As of the time of this being released I have no alternate accounts on the UT CS server.&nbsp;</strong>I left all of my alt accounts because I was not allowed back on so this would truly be ban evasion.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Criticisms about doxxing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was told that <em>I doxxed server members </em>even though there is no evidence of me revealing or threatening to reveal identifying information in a public place. Although I have happened to find information about certain people on the server, and have mentioned that information, I never told anyone else about the information I found out about them, espicially if they requested it to be private. Nathan said I posted his address in general chat, although he sent it himself earlier... <strong>Furthermore, DoktorShark doxxed me by saying my full name before the entire UTCS server, without asking for my response or my opinion privately. </strong>My personal opinion is that if anyone should be in trouble for doxxing it should actually probably be him...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In conclusion, I think I was not being the best Azophi I could be, but many of these accusations have been false or assuming things that are misinformed or simply untrue.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />Should I be banned? <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Yeah, probably. I can be pretty annoying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But should I be reported for this kinda stuff? In my opinion, no.</p>
